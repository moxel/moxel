Here's a sneak peak of the model demo:\n\n\n\n\nWhat is SQuAD?\n\n\nStanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) is a new reading comprehension dataset, consisting of questions posed by crowdworkers on a set of Wikipedia articles, where the answer to every question is a segment of text, or span, from the corresponding reading passage. With 100,000+ question-answer pairs on 500+ articles, SQuAD is significantly larger than previous reading comprehension datasets.\nExplore SQuAD and model predictions\n\n\nCheckout the GitHub repo at \n\n\n\n\nhttps://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Write Prediction\n\n\nFor this example, we'll use the code in \ngithub.com/moxel/tf-bi-att-flow\n, which already has the model inference part written out. \n\n\nCreate a new script called \nserve.py\n, and import from existing modules.\n\n\nfrom squad.demo_prepro import prepro\nfrom basic.demo_cli import Demo\n\n\n\n\nTo serve the model with Moxel, all you need to write is an inference function. Let's call it \nget_answer\n: \n\n\ndemo = Demo()\n\ndef get_answer(paragraph, question):\n    pq_prepro = prepro(paragraph, question)\n    return {\n        'answer': demo.run(pq_prepro)\n    }\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Write the YAML config.\n\n\nCreate a new file called \nmoxel.yml\n. This Moxel config describes basic metadata about the model. \n\n\nname: question-answering\ntag: latest\nimage: py3-tf\nresources:\n  memory: 1Gi\n  cpu: \"1\"\ninput_space:\n  paragraph: str\n  question: str\noutput_space:\n  answer: str\nmain:\n  type: python\n  entrypoint: serve.py::get_answer\n\n\n\n\nIt provides a few specs about the model:\n\n\n\n\nname\n: the repo name under \n/\n.\n\n\ntag\n: versioning of the model.\n\n\nimage\n: the docker image to serve the model in.\n\n\nresources\n: basic resource requirements for the model. If not specified, it will request 1 CPU and 1 GB of memory.\n\n\ninput_space\n: the variables and their types for model input.\n\n\noutput_space\n: the variables and their types for model output.\n\n\nmain\n: the entrypoint to the model. For python deployment, specify the name of a function.\n\n\n\n\nStep 3 (Optional): Test it locally.\n\n\nBefore actually deploying the model, it's helpful to test and debug locally. Moxel provides \n\n\nmoxel serve -f moxel.yml\n\n\n\n\nThis will wrap the python function in a flask server, and start listening at port \n5900\n.\n\n\nTo use the model, create a test script called \ntest_server.py\n:\n\n\nimport moxel\n\nmodel = moxel.Model('<username>/question-answering:latest', where='localhost')\n\noutput = model.predict(\n    paragraph='Daniel is 10 years old.', \n    question: 'How old is Daniel?'\n)\n\nprint(output['answer'])\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Deploy!\n\n\nTo deploy the model, it's simple. Just run\n\n\nmoxel push -f moxel.yml\n\n\n\n\nYou'll see logs streamed live from the model. Shortly, the model will be available under \nbeta.moxel.ai/\\<username>/question-answer\n. \n\n\nOnce you go to the model, spend time to make the page look nice, by adding model description, readme, labels, ... Share it on Facebook / Twitter, and have your friends try it out!",
